  Problem Statement :
Our Enviroment face a lot of Carbon Emission problem due to which it increase the chance of Plants to die,Suffocation, Global warming which is really harmfull to our Earth's Eco-system these Carbon Emission is generally producded from Vehicles , Factories and etc . There is total of 4.6 metric tonns of Co2 produced which is 20% of total of Carbon emission produced around the globe so to reducde it me and my team came up with a solution for each indiviual when to select cars and find the difference between which one produces less carrbon emissions hence therefore EV's are more preferably which very Eco-Friendly to the enviroment
