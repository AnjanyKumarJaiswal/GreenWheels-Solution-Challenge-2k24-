    Problem Statement 


Our Enviroment face a lot of Carbon Emission problem due to which it increase the chance of Plants to die,Suffocation, Global-Warming which is really harmfull to our Earth's Eco-system these Carbon Emission is generally producded from Vehicles , Factories and etc . There is total of 4.6 metric tonns of Co2 produced which is 20% of total of Carbon emission produced around the globe so to reducde it me and my team came up with a solution for each indiviual when to select cars and find the difference between which one produces less carrbon emissions hence therefore EV's are more preferably which very Eco-Friendly to the environment

So me and my team came up with a solution for this particular problem to solve it that we would create an Web-App which would help the country to wisely suggest their people country to choose less Carbon-Emissions free vehicles from each Car-Company there are total of 3 types of vehicles present Petrol , Diesel and Electric among these from our case study and research we found that in most parts of the Globe many countries like in South-Africa , India , Austraila and etc still doesnt have EV's and have a large amount of Carbon Emissions vehicles which is harmful to environment
